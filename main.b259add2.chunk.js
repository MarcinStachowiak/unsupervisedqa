            "Privacy statement": "<h1>Data protection information for online services of Deepset GmbH</h1>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Version: January 2019\n  <br/> Deepset GmbH (\"Deepset\") available by email at <a href=\"mailto:info@deepset.ai\">info@deepset.ai</a> takes the protection of its users' Personal Data seriously. During the processing of Personal Data, data security and the protection of privacy are important concerns of Deepset.\n</p>\n\n<h3>1. General points</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Deepset processes and uses as data controller Personal Data of users of its online services, as far as users have consented or a legal regulation permits the processing or use.\n  <br/> \"Personal Data\" refers to any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable natural person. These include, for example, a user's name, email address and leisure interests.\n</p>\n\n<h3>2. Data processing for contract fulfilment</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>2.1 Website visit\n  <br/> When using the website for information purposes only, i.e. if the user does not register or otherwise provide information to Deepset, Deepset only collects the Personal Data that the user's browser transmits to Deepset's server.\n  <br/> The legal basis for this is the legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR) of Deepset. Within the scope of the necessary balancing of interests, Deepset has weighed the interest of the users in the respective confidentiality of their Personal Data and the interests of Deepset in the provision of this website and the establishment of contact with each other. In both cases, the user's interest in confidentiality is secondary. Deepset could otherwise not provide this website to the user or respond to his/her contact request.\n</p>\n\n<p>If the user wishes to view the Deepset website, Deepset collects the following data, which is technically necessary to display the website and to ensure stability and security:</p>\n\n<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>\n  <li>IP address</li>\n  <li>Date and time of request</li>\n  <li>Content of the request (concrete page)</li>\n  <li>Access Status/HTTP status code</li>\n  <li>respective volume of data transferred</li>\n  <li>The website from which the request originates</li>\n  <li>Browser</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>2.2 Use of the online services\n  <br/> a) If the user wishes to use the labelling tool of deepset, the user must register using the following information:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Email address to ensure that the user belongs to a partner organization and to be able to contact the user for support purposes\n  </li>\n  <li>Organization name</li>\n  <li>Self-chosen password</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n  b) If the user uses the labelling platform, Deepset stores the data required to fulfil the contract until the user finally deletes his/her access. Furthermore, Deepset stores the voluntarily provided data for the period of use of the labelling platform, unless the user deletes this data beforehand.. If the user does not log on to the labelling platform for more than one year, the Personal Data will be deleted. The user can prevent the deletion by logging into the labelling platform again.\n  <br/> The legal basis for this is (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR). The data processing is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract between Deepset and the mentor or mentee.\n</p>\n\n<p>c) When using the labelling platform, the user data may become accessible to other participants of the labelling platform in accordance with the contractual service. Members who are not registered will not receive any information.</p>\n<p>d) In order to prevent unauthorized access by third parties to Personal Data the connection is encrypted using TLS technology.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Use of Stored Data</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>3.1. Use for technical support purposes\n  <br/>During the use of the labelling tool, additional information is collected for the purpose of technical support and security reeasons. This includes the following information:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Operating system\n  </li>\n  <li>Browser used incl. Version</li>\n  <li>Time and date of login\n    <br/>The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3.2. Contact and support form\n  <br/>If users send inquiries to Deepset via the feedback form, the information from the contact form (including the contact data given there, in particular email address, if applicable name and telephone number) will be stored and processed exclusively for processing the inquiry and any potential follow-up questions. We delete the data collected in this context after storage is no longer necessary, or processing is restricted if statutory retention obligations exist.</p>\n\n<p>3.3. Improvement of online services\n  <br/>Deepset uses certain usage data to improve deepset's online services, in particular with regard to their design, type, form and scope.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.4. Use for research purposes\n  <br/>Deepset analyses collected data for the purposes of scientific research, in particular usage statistics. The use for research purposes is carried out only in compliance with legal requirements, and as far as possible on the basis of anonymized data or on the basis of the user's consent.\n</p>\n\n<h3>4. Cookies</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>4.1 Use of cookies\n  <br/>Deepset uses cookies to recognize users during their visit and to store technical data for the correct functioning of the online services on the user's computer. A \"cookie\" is a text file that is stored on the user's computer and allows analysis of use. The so-called session cookies used by Deepset store a so-called session ID with which different requests of the user browser can be assigned to the common session. This allows the user's computer to be recognized when the user returns to the website. The session cookies are deleted when the user logs out or closes the browser.</p>\n\n<p>4.2 Legal basis\n  <br/>The legal basis for processing Personal Data in connection with the cookies used by Deepset is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit f GDPR. The legitimate interest lies in the improvement of the website.</p>\n\n<p>4.3 Deletion of data\n  <br/>The cookies we use are automatically deleted when the user closes the browser.</p>\n\n<p>4.4 Exclusion of the use of cookies\n  <br/>If the use of cookies is not desired, the user can block their use in his/her browser. However, it cannot be ruled out that certain areas of the online services may then not be used or not be used properly.</p>\n\n<p>4.5 Necessity of cookies\n  <br/>Deepset uses cookies to identify the user for follow-up visits if the user has an account with Deepset. Otherwise the user would have to log in again for each visit.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Data storage and deletion</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Personal Data will only be stored and processed as long as this is necessary for the purposes stated herein, in particular the use of the online services of Deepset, or Deepset is legally obliged to store them.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Consents, revocation, information and correction</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>\n  6.1 Consents and revocation\n  <br/> Expressed consent may be revoked at any time, applicable for future interactions. The revocation can take place in the profile on the platform or in writing by email.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  6.2 Information\n  <br/> Users have the right to receive free information about their Personal Data stored by Deepset at any time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  6.3 Correction\n  <br/> If information is stored incorrectly, Deepset will correct it immediately upon request of the user concerned.\n</p>\n\n<h3>7. Additional rights</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>\n  a. Right to object\n  <br/> The user may object to data processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR. Deepset will then stop processing the data. This applies unless Deepset can prove compelling reasons worthy of protection, which outweigh the rights of the user.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  b. The right to data portability\n  <br/> Upon request, Deepset will provide the user with the Personal Data transmitted by the user in a standard machine-readable format, right to data transferability (Art. 20 GDPR).</p>\n\n<p>\n  c. Revocation\n  <br/> If the user has given his/her consent to the processing of Personal Data, he/she can revoke this with Deepset at any time without affecting the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation. This also applies to the revocation of declarations of consent that were given to Deepset before the GDPR was valid, i.e. before 25 May 2018.\n</p>\n\n<p>d. Complaints</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the user has the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of his/her Personal Data by Deepset.</p>\n\n<h3>8. Changes to this data privacy policy</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Deepset reserves the right to change this data privacy policy from time to time. Deepset therefore recommends users to regularly check whether an updated version is available.</p>",

The user ensures compliance with these terms of use through appropriate measures.</p>\n<h3>7. Warranty</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>871 Defects of the Application will be addressed by Deepset within a reasonable time after appropriate notification by the user. The same applies to other Application disturbances for which Deepset is responsible. No right of retention with regards to the separately agreed remuneration exists until the restoration of the agreed scope of services.</p>\n<p>7.2 Any claims for damages due to defective performance shall be governed by section 8 of these terms of use.</p>\n<p>7.3 The user\u2019s right to termination due to failure to grant use according to \xa7 543 para. 2 sentence 1 Nr 1 German Civil Code (BGB) is excluded, if the restoration of contractual use (as defined in the underlying agreement between Deepset and the participating corporate customer) is not deemed failed. A restoration of contractual use is deemed failed at the earliest after the second unsuccessful attempt.</p>\n<h3>8. Liability</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>8.1 Deepset is only liable to users in case of injury to life, body or health, in case of intent or gross negligence, according to the regulations of the Product Liability Act and to the extent of an assumed guarantee.</p>\n<p>8.2 In other cases, Deepset is only liable in case of breach of a material contractual obligation, however limited in the amount to contract-typical damages foreseeable at contract conclusion. "Material contractual obligations" are those that characterize the contract and on whose fulfillment the user can rely.</p>\n<p>8.3 Liability without fault for defects that already existed at contract conclusion is excluded unless the conditions of para. 1 and/or para.2 exist.</p>\n<p>8.4 The above limitations of liability also apply in the event of the fault of a vicarious agent of Deepset as well as for the personal liability of the employees, representatives and organs of Deepset.</p>\n<p>8.5 Deepset is liable for loss of data in any case only up to the amount which would have been necessary to recover the same with proper and regular backup of the data.</p>\n<h3>9. Data protection and data security</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>9.1 The Parties will observe the applicable data protection regulations.</p>\n<p>9.2 Deepset will collect, process and use personal data without express consent only to the extent required for the provision of the online services. Further information can be found in Deepset\'s data protection information.</p>\n<p>9.3 If the user collects, processes or uses personal data, he is responsible for ensuring that he has those rights according to the applicable regulations, in particular data protection regulations, and indemnifies Deepset from any claims of third parties in case of a violation.</p>\n<p>9.4 Deepset is not responsible for the consequences of misuse of user passwords.</p>\n<h3>10. Confidentiality</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>10.1 The Parties shall not disclose any confidential information which has come to their knowledge within the framework of the contractual relationship and shall only use it vis-a-vis third parties - for whatever purpose - with the prior written consent of the other Party. Confidential information includes any information expressly designated as such and any information which should clearly be treated as such based on the circumstances of its disclosure.</p>\n<p>10.2 The obligations under section 9.1 shall not apply to such information or parts of such information for which the receiving Party proves that</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>a) they were known or generally accessible to this Party before the date of receipt or have become lawfully known to it through a third party after the date of receipt without breaching any confidentiality agreement, statutory provisions or official orders;</li>\n  <li>b) they were known to or generally accessible by the public before the receipt date or</li>\n  <li>c) they have become known to or generally accessible by the public without the receiving Party being responsible for this or</li>\n  <li>d) they were required to be disclosed due to statutory obligations or at the order of a court or an authority. The recipient obliged to disclose will, as far as permissible and possible, inform the other Party in advance and give it the opportunity to take action against the disclosure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10.3 Public declarations of cooperation by the Parties shall only be made after mutual advance agreement. The user is not entitled to use information about an intended or existing contractual cooperation for reference or marketing purposes without the prior consent of Deepset.</p>\n<p>10.4 The obligations under section 9.1 continue to apply beyond the end of the contract for an indefinite period, but at least for a period of five years after termination of the contract, as long as an exception under section 10.2 is not proven.</p>\n<h3>11. Blocking of access</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>11.1 Deepset reserves the right, in the event of suspicion of misuse or material breach of contract (in particular with regard to the provisions of section 5), to investigate these events, to take appropriate precautions and, in the event of justified suspicion, to block access of the user in accordance with section 11.2.</p>\n<p>11.2 Deepset may, in cases according to section 11.1 after prior written notification of the user, temporarily block access to the Application, unless the violation cannot be stopped by this. As soon as the suspicion can be dispelled, the blocking will be lifted again.</p>\n<p>11.3 In case of continuous or repeated violations, Deepset can extraordinarily terminate the contractual relationship without observing a period of notice according to section 12.3, unless the user is not responsible for the violation.</p>\n<p>11.4 The right of Deepset to claim damages remains unaffected.</p>\n<h3>12. Duration and termination</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>12.1 The contract for the use of the Application comes into effect upon completion of the registration process and confirmation of registration by Deepset (section 2). It terminates automatically upon termination of the underlying agreement between Deepset and the participating corporate customer.</p>\n<p>12.2 The contract may be ordinarily terminated at any time by either Party with a notice period of three months to the end of a calendar month.</p>\n<p>12.3 The right to extraordinary termination for good cause without observing a period of notice remains unaffected by this. In particular, Deepset may terminate the contract without notice if the user makes use of the Application contrary to the contract, in particular consigns the use to a third party without authorization.</p>\n<p>12.4 Upon termination of the contract, all permissions and registrations of the user according to these terms of use automatically expire.</p>\n<h3>13. Final provisions</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>13.1 All claims and obligations arising from and in connection with this contractual relationship shall be governed by the law of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of the UN Sales Convention.</p>\n<p>13.2 Changes or additions to these terms of use as well as legally relevant declarations and notifications to be made by the user to Deepset must be in written form to be effective. Text form is not sufficient. This also applies for waiving of the requirement for the written form.</p>\n<p>13.3 The invalidity of individual provisions of these terms of use shall not affect the validity of the remaining content of the contract. If gaps arise in the practical execution of the contract which the Parties have not provided for, or if the ineffectiveness of a provision is legally binding or determined by both Parties in agreement, the Parties undertake to fill in or replace this gap or ineffective provision in an objective and appropriate manner oriented towards the economic purpose of the contract.</p>\n<p>13.4 The exclusive place of jurisdiction is the seat of Deepset\'s office, provided the user is a merchant, a legal person governed by public law or represents fund assets subject to public law.</p>\n<p>Deepset GmbH</p>'
